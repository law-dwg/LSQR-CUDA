# LSQR-CUDA
## Overview
LSQR-CUDA was written by Lawrence Ayers under the supervision of Stefan Guthe of the [GRIS](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/gris/startseite_1/team/index.de.jsp) institute at the Technische Universität Darmstadt.

The goal of this work was to accelerate the computation time of the well-known [LSQR](https://web.stanford.edu/group/SOL/software/lsqr/) algorithm using a CUDA compatibile GPGPU.

# C++ and CUDA implementations of the lsqr algorithm
The following repository is split into two folders, one for the cpu implementation of lsqr, and one for the gpu implementation of lsqr.

# GPU Implementation
The Kernels used in this implementation are all 2-Dimensional, and can all handle matricies of large various sizes depending on the capabilities of the GPU.

Here, the speed of both naive and optimizied algorithms are analyzed and compared. 

## Naive kernels


## Optimized kernels

### Transpose
The transpose kernel utilizes coalesced memory access via shared memory (block scope).

### Multiply
